# Unifront
This Latex package gives your notes a unique front page for every chapter and section.

# Introduction
This package can help you format your notes easily and give them a unique front page for every chapter and section.

It automatically calculates your progress and then displays the progress bar under the title.

You can also customise the colour of the bar.

You still need to enter your current completed titles, you can easily do this with a command that accepts Variable Arguments. Still, that also helped you review your notes.

It also displays a partial table of contents under every progress bar and only shows the subdirectories of the current part. 

# How to use
Simply download unifront.sty and put it in the same directory as your .tex file.

And then follow the instruction in unifront.pdf.

You can also check example.pdf and example.tex to get an overall experience.
