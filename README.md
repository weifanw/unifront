# Unifront
This Latex package gives your notes a unique front page for every chapter and section.

## Description
This package can help you format your notes easily and give them a unique front page for every chapter and section.

It calculates your progress and then displays the progress bar under the title.

It also displays a partial table of contents under every progress bar and only shows the subdirectories of the current part.

To generate this, you can simply enter your current completed titles with a command that accepts Variable Arguments. Still, that also helped you review your notes.

You can also customise the colour of the bar.

## How to use
Simply download unifront.sty and put it in the same directory as your .tex file.

And then follow the instruction in unifront-manual.pdf.

You can also check unifront-example.pdf and unifront-example.tex to get an overall experience.
